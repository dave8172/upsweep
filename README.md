# upsweep

**Find Upwork jobs that match your filters, and see what clients in your niche keep asking for.**

A skill for AI agents: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot, OpenCode and others. It uses Upwork's official MCP, so it reads Upwork through your own login. No scraping, and no extra keys.

Say **"upsweep"** and you get:

1. **Matching jobs:** every job that passes your filters (verified payment, posted recently, few proposals, a client who actually hires, client location), newest first. Each comes with the link and the Connects cost.
2. **What those clients ask for:** the problems they describe most, the tools they name (including ones missing from your profile), what they screen applicants on, typical budgets, and how fast posts fill up.

## Install

```
npx skills add dave8172/upsweep
```

This works for most agents; it asks which ones to install into. To get the latest rules and fixes later, run `npx skills update upsweep`. Then say **"upsweep"**. If Upwork isn't connected yet, the skill sets it up or shows you how. That's usually one command, then signing in to Upwork.

For Claude on the web or desktop, download this repo as a ZIP, upload the `skills/upsweep` folder under Customize → Skills, and add the Upwork connector.

## First run

The skill reads your Upwork profile and proposes your searches and filters in one message. Reply **ok**, or change anything in plain words.

| Filter | Default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Payment verified | yes | The client has a payment method on file |
| Posted within | 5 days | Clients who hire usually do it within 3–5 days |
| Proposals | under 20 | Past that, a good proposal gets buried |
| Client hire rate | 80%+ | Some clients post and never hire. New clients are shown and labelled |
| Hourly floor | 60% of your profile rate | Hides the bargain-bin posts |
| Fixed-price floor | $100 | Same |
| Client location | any | Keep only, or exclude, the countries or regions you name |

## What a sweep looks like

The shape of a report. Your counts come from your own sweep; nothing is kept afterwards.

> **Matches (newest first):** linked title · posted · client country · budget · proposals · client hire rate and spend · Connects
>
> **One filter away:** up to 5 jobs, each with its client country and the filter it missed
>
> **What these clients ask for (out of N jobs):**
> - the problems they describe most, each with a count
> - the tools they name, with ✗ on any missing from your profile skills
> - what they screen applicants on, counted from the postings read in full
> - typical budgets, and how many already had 20+ proposals

## Then

- **"draft 2"**: a short proposal draft for job 2. The hook comes first, then your real proof, then a question. Put it in your own words, then submit it on Upwork, or say **"send"** and the agent shows you Upwork's preview to approve.
- **"change filters"**: edit them in plain words.

## Plays by Upwork's rules

Upwork's [API & MCP Terms](https://www.upwork.com/legal#apimcpterms) set the limits, and upsweep stays inside them:
- It runs only when you ask, never on a schedule.
- It uses only your search terms and filters, and never ranks jobs by its own judgment.
- It stores no job data. Only your settings are saved, in `~/.upsweep/profile.md`.
- A sweep only reads. A proposal is sent only after you approve Upwork's preview for it, one at a time.

## Good to know

- **Cost:** a sweep is about 25–30 read-only calls and takes about 3 minutes. Measured on Claude Opus through the API, it was ~$1.75 including setup; on a subscription it uses your plan.
- **Agent support:** tested on Claude Code. Connection steps for every other agent are in [`skills/upsweep/connect.md`](skills/upsweep/connect.md).
- **Not affiliated with Upwork.** Upwork is a trademark of Upwork Inc.; this project is unofficial and not endorsed by Upwork.
